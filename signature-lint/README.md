# PrivacyCriticalRegion signing
## Creating a PrivacyCriticalRegion signature
Each PCR signature is unique to the closure it signs. We use ssh-keygen to sign and verify the signed file. 

To create a signature, run the `sign.sh` script.
The arguments are the path to a private key linked with your Github and a text file containing the closure to sign. 
<!--- Make code --->
    ./sign.sh /Users/name/.ssh/id_ed25519 src/pcr/closure-to-sign 

The closure snippet can be copy-pasted into a text file or generated by the lint in a file of the form `region_*`.

The `alohomora::pcr::Signature` struct takes as arguments a github username and the PCR-specific signature. 
```rust
Signature {
    username: "corinnt", 
    signature: "LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBTU0ggU0lHTkFUVVJFLS0tLS0KVTFOSVUwbEhBQUFBQVFBQUFETUFBQUFMYzNOb0xXVmtNalUxTVRrQUFBQWd6dGJjeE9zVzlOL09Fd2c3Y3BKZ3dUQnFMNgpGazI2ZVB2Rm1ZaXpRRjM1VUFBQUFFWm1sc1pRQUFBQUFBQUFBR2MyaGhOVEV5QUFBQVV3QUFBQXR6YzJndFpXUXlOVFV4Ck9RQUFBRUNqRStac3YzcUhROG8zL1ZOVmxacVB5MzV4REI3Ti9FVkljaFB4bllXZWFqQjQ4WC9Dc1VpcG1RN0N2RHNucXkKV1REandZVHlVUThxUWJMR0VCelJzRwotLS0tLUVORCBTU0ggU0lHTkFUVVJFLS0tLS0K"}
```

Changing the source code of the PCR will invalidate the previous signature. 

Currently, Signatures must be declared inline with the PrivacyCriticalRegion declaration.

## The signature lint

### What does it do?

### Why is this bad?

### Known problems
Remove if none.

### Example
```rust
// example code where a warning is issued
```
Use instead:
```rust
// example code that does not raise a warning
```
